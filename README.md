This is the first challenge of many that will be completed for University of Arizona Virtual Code Bootcamp. This is a project showing basic code refactoring of a pre-made website made using HTML and CSS.

## The Base Code
The code started from a premade file which included HTML, CSS, and a few images. These made up the website

### Languages Used
The project is done in both HTML and CSS.

### What was Done
The appearance of the website, once launched, is completely unchanged compared to its original visual presentation. There only things that were changed are in the code, which was made to look more organized and was shortened in places (particularly in the CSS) so there weren't redundancies in what needed to be done. A common occurence was multiple classes created that all accomplish the exact same thing. Such instances in the CSS were changed to only require a single class, which could be called upon multiple times in the HTML. Some other minor changes were made in the HTML just to make sure that each function of href="#insert-thing-here#" brings the user to the proper section within the website.

### Credits
The original code belongs to the University of Arizona Virtual Coding Bootcamp.
